## What This ML Model Can Do:
#### Predict dengue cases based on environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, NDVI).
#### Evaluate multiple models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM) using cross-validation.
#### Identify important environmental features for dengue prediction.
#### Handle missing values by filling with mean values.
#### Train a Random Forest model to predict total dengue cases.
#### Predict total cases for unseen test data.
#### What This ML Model Cannot Do:
#### Forecast long-term trends or future changes in environmental conditions.
#### Establish causal relationships between features and dengue cases.
#### Handle non-numeric data without preprocessing.
#### Perform real-time predictions without further modification.
#### Adapt to new features without retraining.
#### Handle data anomalies or errors without affecting prediction accuracy.
